Small and simple plugin that allows you to set a trial period for your website.

== Description ==
Do you want to get paid every time, and in time? Install this simple plugin that puts the website offline until you receive the payment.
The website will be in Trial mode. Every day a notification box appears on the screen reminding the customer how many days are left before the website goes offline.
On the last day the website goes offline and a warning message appears, prompting to contact the administrator. Once you get the payment, you deactivate the plugin and the website is again online.

It's simple to use.
Just a few fields to fill in, like the position of the notification box, the background color, the message.

2. Activate the plugin through the \'Plugins\' screen in WordPress
